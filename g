<span>This project, Traces: A Palimpsest Project, proposes a series of architectural interventions within the Convict Precinct of Cockatoo Island that aim to reveal, not reconstruct, the site's layered history. Through a restrained palette of stone, earth, and timber, the design makes memory legible in material and movement—inviting the public to engage with what has been erased, forgotten, or overlooked.</span>
<span>Three key interventions form the spatial sequence: a re-inscribed sandstone pathway, a lightweight modular timber roof, and a courtyard framed by rammed earth walls. Each draws on a different aspect of the island’s past—its vanished structures, its constrained atmospheres, its cultivated yet controlled gardens—and offers a new mode of engagement. The path traces foundations with locally sourced and reclaimed sandstone, transforming the act of walking into a reading of the ground. The timber roof, assembled from recycled plywood, reanimates the barracks interior by framing material details, offering vertical access, and layering multiple perspectives. The courtyard garden, defined by unstabilised rammed earth walls and endemic flora, inverts the oppressive logic of the original fortress walls—replacing confinement with reflection.</span>
<span>Materials are sourced with intent: sandstone from the island and nearby quarries, earth from metro excavations across Sydney, and timber reused from formwork processes. These choices reinforce a practice of low-impact, circular construction while grounding the project in both geological and civic continuity.</span>
<span>Ultimately, Traces: A Palimpsest Project draws inspiration from the ethos of unofficial art—architecture as humble, grounded storytelling. It proposes that enduring cultural memory can emerge not from monumental gestures, but from careful, crafted acts that expose what time has layered into the land. In doing so, it offers a spatial narrative that connects past and present through texture, light, and the quiet persistence of material.</span>
