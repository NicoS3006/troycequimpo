                Philosophy as an Architect
            </h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mx-auto">
                Troyce Garrett Quimpo's architectural philosophy is rooted in the seamless integration of functionality, sustainability, and human-centric design. His approach prioritises creating spaces that not only serve their intended purpose but also enhance the lives of those who inhabit them. Architecture, he believes, should tell a story, capturing the essence of its environment while responding to the needs of its users.
